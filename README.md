# Image Compression Tool

## Description: 
This tool can create filters for given images and works by taking an image and storing
image pixels in an array allowing pixel manipulations to be made to allow filters. There
is a folder called filter_previews which shows the different types of filter and how they
look applied to a sample image. Images are saved as .jpg files

Examples:
- blue filter
![example image1](expected_filter_results/blue_filter.jpg)
- blur filer
![example image2](expected_filter_results/blur_filter.jpg)
- blur filter 3x3
![example image3](expected_filter_results/blur_filter3x3.jpg)
- blur filter 4x3
![example image4](expected_filter_results/blur_filter4x3.jpg)
- blurry image filter
![example image5](expected_filter_results/blurry_image_filter.jpg)
- cropped image filter
![example image6](expected_filter_results/cropped_image.jpg)
- edge detection filter
![example image7](expected_filter_results/edge_detection_filter.jpg)
- green filter
![example image8](expected_filter_results/green_filter.jpg)
- greyscale alternate filter
![example image9](expected_filter_results/greyscale_alternate_filter.jpg)
- greyscale filter
![example image10](expected_filter_results/greyscale_filter.jpg)
- liminosity filter
![example image11](expected_filter_results/luminosity_filter.jpg)
- pink filter
![example image12](expected_filter_results/pink_filter.jpg)
- reduce opacity filter

- sharpen filter

- unsharpen mask filter

- yellow filter
